There were three little pigs, the wolf came to blow their houses down.

The first little pig had a house made of straw, and the wolf huffed and puffed and blew it down.

The first pig ran to the second pig’s house, which was made of wood. The wolf took an axe and destroyed the house. The pigs fled.

The two pigs went to the third pig’s house, and they were safe because the third pig’s house was a bomb shelter. The wolf went away.
